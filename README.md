## Introduction

This repository demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and advanced TypeScript features. Each file focuses on specific TypeScript functionalities, such as decorators, generics, interfaces, and class-based inheritance.

The repository is ideal for learning and implementing TypeScript features, particularly in OOP contexts.

---

## Features

- Demonstrates OOP principles:
  - Classes
  - Inheritance
  - Interfaces
  - Static properties and methods
- Advanced TypeScript functionalities:
  - Decorators
  - Generics
  - Generic interfaces
- Modular and concise examples for better understanding.
